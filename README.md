![User interface](/screenshot.png)

A Java Swing parking to monitor the state of parking spots in a parking lot creating a continuous car-threads traffic simulation and illustrating a case of concurrency solved by means of two Semaphores.

Features
-------------------
* The application creates a parking system as a shared resource for cars to park, providing 107 regular parking spots and 2 reduced mobility reserved spots.
* Two different Semaphore objects regulate the acquiring and releasing of permits to park in the regular/reduced mobility parking spots.
* The application generates an infinite time-paced flow of threads, each representing a car requesting a permit to use the parking lot.
* The Car objects generated include attributes of a random license plate number in Spain's format, a random brand and car model picked from a resource file and the fact of being a reduced mobility car or not regulated by a probability.
